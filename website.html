<body><font color="#A47C44"><center>Speeding is an aggressive driving behavior that causes many accidents on the road. There are many consequences in speeding, like lost vehicle control, increased stopping distance and increased fuel cost. Speeding also costs traffic because the driver is changing lanes frequently. Some of those people drive in aggressive behavior either they are late in meetings, school and other appointments. Speeding endangers not only the life of drivers but also to other drivers. Speeding also affects your safety every time you drive during bad weather or any natural disaster risks. As  a driver, avoid speeding for your safety and for the other people.

<body><h2><font color="#5B3310"><center><b>RECKLESS DRIVING</b></center></font></h2></body>

<body><h2><font color="#6A2E20"><center><b>VEHICLE BREAKDOWN</b></center></font></h2></body>
<body><font color="#A47C44"><center>Vehicle breakdown safety hazards refer to potential risks or dangers that can arise when a vehicle breaks down or suffers a mechanical failure, particularly on a busy road or highway. Here are seven sentences explaining this concept:
  <br><br></br></br>
1. When a vehicle breaks down, it can become stationary or slow moving in a travel lane, potentially creating a hazard for other traffic.
  <br>
2. A vehicle breakdown may result in a sudden stop or deceleration, which can cause a rear-end collision with another vehicle.
<br>
3. A broken-down vehicle can also create a sight obstruction for other drivers, reducing visibility and increasing the risk of a crash.
<br>
4. Moreover, a vehicle breakdown can cause drivers to become confused or disoriented, leading to incorrect decisions or actions.
<br>
5. As a result, vehicle breakdown safety hazards can include a wide range of risks such as accidents, injuries, and even fatalities.
<br>
6. Therefore, it is essential for drivers to have a clear understanding of the hazards and risks associated with a vehicle breakdown, as well as to be prepared for unexpected situations on the road.
<br>
7. It is recommended to regularly maintain your vehicle and keep an emergency kit in your car to ensure your safety in case of a breakdown.</center></font></body>

<body><h2><font color="#5B3310"><center><b>DRIVING IN THE RAIN</b></center></font></h2></body>
<body><font color="#A47C44"><center>Driving in the rain can effect your driving performance and your vehicles mechanics.
  one of the reasons are REduced visibility. because the rain can cause your windshield and windows to bead up with water,
  making it difficult to see the road ahead. another one of them is Slipping and sliding. the rain can cause the roads to become
  slick and reduce traction, increasing the risk of skidding of losing control of the vehicle. When driving in the rain, you need a professional by your
  side to guide your way and help you drive. but if you are a professional yourself still watch out. always focus on the road.
</center></font></body>
<body><h2><font color="#5B3310"><center><b>USING A MOBILE PHONE WHILE DRIVING</b></center></font></h2></body>
<body><font color="#A47644"><center>There are multiple PSAs because of using a mobile phone while driving. one of the PSAs is
  this <i><a href="https://youtu.be/O8MQV40pOtk?si=jm-zYFQTto-Hvwd5" target="">link</a></i>
  or <i><a href="https://youtu.be/8UFB7CbYtKA?si=s1q4Myw7QovWGlOO" target="">link.</a></i> When it is unescessary dont pick up your mobile phone. and if it is nescessary, ask someone in the
  car to answer or text someone on your mobile phone. if none, dont pick up your mobile phone. you can pick up your mobile phone <u>after</u>
  you had finished driving. anything or anyone is not important when youre driving because it will put your life at sake. and it might harm
  other people or animals too. <br>(ex:pedestrians, pets, passengers)</br>

<br></br>
<body><h2><font color="#5B3310"><center><b>RUNNING</b></center></font></h2></body>
<body><font color="A47C44"><center>Running is often and very a common reason why pesdestrians get hit. this is why in other countries
  they have signals attached to pole so that they will know when to go or not. unfortunately other countries do <i>NOT</i>
  have these. they will just rely on their self into crossing the road. this is very dangerous for people mostly some minors,
  because they might get hit when crossing the road while running and blame it on the driver. sometimes its the drivers fault
but mostly the Victim/s. Make sure to <u>look left and right when crossing the road.</u> or wait until the road is clear, then you
  can cross. this is also the reason why there is pedestrian lane. so that they can cross carefully, and the drivers can slow down to
  check if someone is crossing. and if you are in a hurry dont rush, it will be very risky if youre running, especially everywhere.
</center></font></body> 
<body><h2><font color="#5B3310"><center>NOT FOCUSING AHEAD OF YOU</center></font></h2></body>
<body><font color="#a47c44"><center><i>look left and right when crossing the road</i> is said everywhere to people
  who dont know how to cross the road and a starter rule for anyone crossing the road. some think that this rule is
  Stupid, when actually it saved many lives. if you are crossing the road do not focus on anything else except
  left,right, and straight. also, If you are busy looking at your phone or talking to someone near you. continue it
  after crossing the road. always pay attention to where you are going or where you are heading.</center></font></body>

<body><h2><font color="#5B3310"><b><center>DISTRACTING THE DRIVER</center></b></font></h2></body>
  <body><font color="#A47C44"><center>Distracting the driver can affect his/her driving performance. distracting the driver
  will make them focus on you more than the road, not focusing on the road will might give you,the driver, and other drivers
  might get harm. if you are a passenger, please keep quiet. being noisy can distract the driver, even talking to him/her can distract
  them. if <i>they want</i> to talk to you, talk to them. he/she might feel sleepy or bored in the car. interact to the
  driver time to time. If you are talking to another passenger, talk to them quietly. its better to not include the driver but
  if they wants to include them as i said, talk to them time to time. that way he could still focus on the road while talking
  to you or them.</center></font></body>
  <body><h2><font color="#5B3310"><b><center>MAINTAIN YOUR COOL</center></b></font></h2></body>
  <body><font color="#A47C44"><center>If the driver wants you to express yourself in the car, its better to limit it.
    because spilling all of your emotions in the car can irritate the driver. even when you have the permission to.
    if youre feeling sad, tell someone else either on the phone or the person next to you. always keep calm on the vehicle.
    also if you are making a scene in the car, remember the driver is there listening to you and it might distract them like in
    the previous paragraph. Remember, let the driver decide what you want to talk about. he is the leader and the owner of the
    vehicle and you must respect him.
